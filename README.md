### This website is built using React framework and Express.js in the backend, along with Firebase for data management.


### One of the key features of the website is its integration with Razorpay , a secure payment gateway. This ensures that all online transactions made on the website are safe and secure. This is especially important for events like college fests, where payments need to be made by students and participants.

In addition to Razorpay , the website also features a Google authentication login mechanism, making it easier for users to sign in and register for events. This helps streamline the user experience and ensures that participants can quickly and easily access all the features of the website.

The website also boasts a user-friendly interface, making it easy for visitors to navigate and find the information they need. It has been designed with the aim of providing a seamless and enjoyable experience for users.

One of the standout features of the website is the user dashboard, where visitors to the website can register for events and view their registration details, including the events they have registered for and their payment status. The dashboard makes it easy for users to keep track of their activities on the website and stay updated about their participation in the fest.

Another notable feature of the website is the ticketing system, where users are issued tickets with unique QR codes as proof of their registration. These tickets can be easily accessed through the dashboard . Users can save them on their phones to be scanned at the entrance of the event. The ticketing system eliminates the need for physical tickets and ensures that all participants have proof of their registration.

Overall, I am proud of the website that we have created for NAKSHATRA 23. It was a challenging project, but one that I believe has been successful in meeting the needs of the college and its students.
